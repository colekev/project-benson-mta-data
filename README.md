# project-benson-mta-data

This repo contains the [presentation](https://github.com/colekev/project-benson-mta-data/blob/master/Benson%20project.pdf) and [partial code](https://github.com/colekev/project-benson-mta-data/blob/master/mta_july_2015.ipynb) from my first group project as part of the [12-week data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) at Metis.

Much of the code is written as a "brut force" solution, as my programming skills are fairly rudimentary only a week into the program. That said, our group was able to make sense of the somewhat confusing and mislabeled New York City [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).
